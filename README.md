# Goal

Your goal is to design and implement a complete C++ program that allows individuals to practice their integer math skills both interactively and with program generated practice sheets.

## Program Specifications
 * Allow the	user	to	select	– interactive	work,	practice	sheet	generation or	stop*
   - Allow	the	user	to	select		- addition,	subtraction,	multiplication,	division	
      with	quotient	and	remainder	(think	grade	school	long	division),	a	
      mixture	of	all	four problem	types,	or	stop*
     - allow	the	user	to	select	the	upper	bound	of	the	number	of	digits	for	the	problems
     - allow	the	user	to	select	the	use	of	positive	only,	
       negative	only	and	positive/negative	random	mix	of	 numbers	in	the problems
     - write/display	problems	in	the	clear,	readable	format:	one	possibility:	operand	operator	operand	=	?
     
	   (for	example:	2	+	4	=	?)
     
 * generate	problem	sets	of	size	10	with	randomly	generated	operands	that	
   meet	the	user	choices for	size	and	sign
 * for	interactive	play	notify	the	user	if	their	answer	is	correct	or	not	for	each problem
 * for	practice	sheet	generation
   - allow	the	user	to	name	the	output	file
   - generate	a	solution	file	with	the	same	file	name	+	“key”	added	to	the	
     name
   - write	the	user’s	name,	first	and	last,	to	the	output	file	to	personalize	it
   - make	the	sheet	esthetically	pleasing	and	nicely	spaced	to	allow	user	
     space	to	calculate	their	answer while	keeping	all	10	problems	on	one	
     page
   - the	solution	file	should	state	each	problem	and, for	each, the	
     associated	correct	answer
     
\*		indicates that	menu	and	choice	selection/processing	should	repeat	until	the	user	
chooses	to	stop	the	process

## Things to note
1. This	is	an	individual	project	– not	a	group	project.	You	may	consult	with	
peers	as	to	concepts	and	thoughts	but	all	work	submitted	must	be	your	
own	work.	Do	not	share	your	code	with	others.

2. Nothing	will	be	accepted	after the	due	dates/times	listed	on	the	calendar.		

3. No	global	variables	are	to	be	used.		A grade	of	0	will	be	given	if	used.

4. Use	only	concepts/constructs	found	in	the	first	6	chapters	of	our	text	
book	and	not	use	global	variables,	exit,	continue,	goto	and	break	(other	
than	as	standard	use	in	switch	statements)	statements;	only	have	one	
return	statement	per	function.

5. The	program	must	include	a	minimum	of	6 functions.		The	main()
function	is	to	be	a	driver	function.		A grade	of	0	will	be	given	for	less than	
6	functions.

6. The	submitted	program	must	compile regardless	of	its	state	of	
completion.		A	0	will	be	given	for	a	program	that	does	not	compile.

7. The	code	must	include	comments.		Comments	shall	consist	of	(a)	a	
comment	header	at	the	start	of	each	source	code	file,	(b)	a	comment	
header	at	the	start	of	each	function	definition,	and	(c)	brief,	meaningful	
comments	throughout	the	code	that	allow	a	human	to	follow	it	w/out	
reading	it	line-for-line.		There	will	be	a	grade	of	0	for	no,	or	50%	loss	of	
grade	for	meaningless,	comments.
